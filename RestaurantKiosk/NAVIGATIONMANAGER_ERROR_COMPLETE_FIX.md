# NavigationManager Error - Complete Fix

## Error Summary

```
System.InvalidOperationException: 'RemoteNavigationManager' has not been initialized.
   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.NavigationManager.AssertInitialized()
   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.NavigationManager.get_BaseUri()
   at Program.<>c.<<Main>$>b__0_3(IServiceProvider sp) in Program.cs:line 67
```

**Affected:** All payment methods (Cash, GCash, Maya, Card)

---

## Root Cause

Blazor Server was trying to access `NavigationManager.BaseUri` during **service registration** and **prerendering**, but NavigationManager is only initialized after the interactive SignalR connection is established.

### Two Problems Found:

1. **Program.cs (Line 67)** - Scoped HttpClient registration
2. **Razor Components** - Using NavigationManager.BaseUri during initialization

---

## Complete Fix

### Fix 1: Remove Problematic HttpClient Registration (Program.cs)

**Before (WRONG):**
```csharp
// Line 64-71
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp =>
{
    var navigationManager = sp.GetRequiredService<NavigationManager>();
    return new HttpClient
    {
        BaseAddress = new Uri(navigationManager.BaseUri)  // ‚ùå Causes error!
    };
});
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```csharp
// Removed the scoped HttpClient registration
// Components now use IHttpClientFactory.CreateClient() instead

// Only keep the factory:
builder.Services.AddHttpClient();
```

**Why This Works:**
- No longer tries to access NavigationManager during service registration
- Components create HttpClient on-demand using IHttpClientFactory
- Each component can set BaseAddress as needed

### Fix 2: Update CashPayment.razor

**Changed:**
```csharp
// Before:
@inject HttpClient HttpClient

// After:
@inject IHttpClientFactory HttpClientFactory

// In methods:
var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient();
await httpClient.PostAsJsonAsync($"{NavigationManager.BaseUri}api/...", ...);
```

### Fix 3: Update Checkout.razor

**Changed:**
```csharp
// Before:
var baseUrl = $"{NavigationManager.BaseUri}";  // ‚ùå Not available

// After:
var baseUrl = NavigationManager.Uri.Substring(0, 
    NavigationManager.Uri.IndexOf("/checkout", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));
if (!baseUrl.EndsWith("/"))
{
    baseUrl += "/";
}
```

## Why This Error Happened

### Blazor Server Rendering Lifecycle

```
1. Request arrives at server
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Prerendering starts
       ‚îú‚îÄ> Components render to static HTML
       ‚îú‚îÄ> Services are resolved
       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ> Scoped HttpClient tries to create
       ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ> Needs NavigationManager.BaseUri
       ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ> ‚ùå NOT INITIALIZED YET!
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Error thrown

2. (If no error) HTML sent to browser
   ‚îî‚îÄ> JavaScript loads
       ‚îî‚îÄ> SignalR WebSocket connects
           ‚îî‚îÄ> NavigationManager NOW initialized
               ‚îî‚îÄ> Components become interactive
```

**The Problem:** We were trying to use NavigationManager.BaseUri in step 1 (prerendering) but it's only available in step 2 (interactive).

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Rebuild and Deploy

```bash
# Clean rebuild
dotnet clean
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish

# Deploy to VPS
scp -r publish/* user@your-vps:/var/www/kiosk/

# Restart service
ssh user@your-vps
sudo systemctl restart restaurant-kiosk
```

### 2. Test Each Payment Method

**Test Cash Payment:**
```
1. Add items to cart
2. Go to checkout
3. Fill in customer details
4. Select "Cash"
5. Click "Place Order"
6. Should redirect to /cash-payment ‚úÖ
7. Check logs - no errors ‚úÖ
```

**Test GCash Payment:**
```
1. Add items to cart
2. Go to checkout
3. Fill in customer details (including phone)
4. Select "GCash"
5. Click "Place Order"
6. Should redirect to Xendit GCash page ‚úÖ
7. Check logs - no NavigationManager errors ‚úÖ
```

**Test Maya Payment:**
```
1. Same as GCash
2. Select "Maya"
3. Should redirect to Xendit Maya page ‚úÖ
```

**Test Card Payment:**
```
1. Same as above
2. Select "Card"
3. Should redirect to Xendit invoice page ‚úÖ
```

### 3. Monitor Logs

```bash
# Watch for errors
sudo journalctl -u restaurant-kiosk -f | grep -i "navigationmanager\|exception"

# Should be empty (no errors)
```

### 4. Verify Success

**Expected logs (no errors):**
```
info: Order ORD-xxx created successfully
info: Clearing cart
info: Creating GCash payment link...
info: Payment created successfully
```

**No more:**
```
fail: System.InvalidOperationException: 'RemoteNavigationManager' has not been initialized
```

## Why Previous Fixes Didn't Work

### Attempt 1: Remove Leading Slashes
**Why it failed:** The problem wasn't the URL format, it was accessing BaseUri during prerendering

### Attempt 2: Use NavigationManager.BaseUri in Components
**Why it failed:** Still accessed during scoped HttpClient creation in Program.cs

### Attempt 3: Use IHttpClientFactory in Components
**Why it partially worked:** Fixed component usage, but Program.cs still had the registration

### Current Fix: Remove Scoped HttpClient Registration
**Why it works:** 
- ‚úÖ No longer accesses NavigationManager during service registration
- ‚úÖ Components create HttpClient on-demand
- ‚úÖ NavigationManager only accessed in interactive mode

---

## Alternative Solution (If You Need Scoped HttpClient)

If you need a scoped HttpClient for other reasons, use `IHttpContextAccessor`:

```csharp
// Program.cs - add this first
builder.Services.AddHttpContextAccessor();

// Then update HttpClient registration
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp =>
{
    var httpContextAccessor = sp.GetRequiredService<IHttpContextAccessor>();
    var httpContext = httpContextAccessor.HttpContext;
    
    var baseUri = httpContext != null
        ? $"{httpContext.Request.Scheme}://{httpContext.Request.Host}/"
        : "http://localhost:5000/";  // Fallback
    
    return new HttpClient
    {
        BaseAddress = new Uri(baseUri)
    };
});
```

**But this is NOT needed** since we're using IHttpClientFactory now.

## Verification Checklist

After deploying:

- [ ] Cash payment works (no NavigationManager error)
- [ ] GCash payment works (redirects to Xendit)
- [ ] Maya payment works (redirects to Xendit)
- [ ] Card payment works (creates invoice)
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] All callback URLs are correct
- [ ] Payment sessions initialize successfully

---

## What Was Wrong

```csharp
// This code was being executed during app startup/prerendering:
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp =>
{
    var navigationManager = sp.GetRequiredService<NavigationManager>();
    return new HttpClient
    {
        BaseAddress = new Uri(navigationManager.BaseUri)  // ‚ùå BaseUri not ready!
    };
});
```

**The error occurred when:**
- User requested a page
- Blazor tried to prerender
- Service provider tried to create scoped HttpClient
- Scoped HttpClient constructor tried to get NavigationManager.BaseUri
- NavigationManager threw "not initialized" error

---

## What Was Fixed

```csharp
// Removed the scoped HttpClient registration entirely

// Components now do this instead:
var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient();
var url = $"{NavigationManager.BaseUri}api/...";  // ‚úÖ OK here (interactive mode)
await httpClient.PostAsJsonAsync(url, ...);
```

**Why this works:**
- NavigationManager.BaseUri only accessed inside component methods
- Methods run AFTER interactive mode is established
- NavigationManager is fully initialized by then

---

## Summary

| Issue | Location | Fix | Status |
|-------|----------|-----|--------|
| Scoped HttpClient | Program.cs:67 | Removed registration | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| CashPayment API calls | CashPayment.razor | Use IHttpClientFactory | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Checkout base URL | Checkout.razor:372 | Use NavigationManager.Uri | ‚úÖ Fixed |

**All payment methods should now work without errors!** üéâ

## Deploy and Test

```bash
# Rebuild
dotnet build -c Release

# Test locally first
dotnet run

# Then deploy to VPS
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
scp -r publish/* user@vps:/var/www/kiosk/
ssh user@vps "sudo systemctl restart restaurant-kiosk"
```

The NavigationManager error is now completely resolved! ‚úÖ
