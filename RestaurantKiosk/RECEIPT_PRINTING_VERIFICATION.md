# Receipt Printing Verification Guide

## Overview
Receipt printing has been implemented for **all payment methods** (Cash, GCash, Maya, and Credit Card/Invoice payments).

## Implementation Details

### 1. Cash Payments
**File:** `Controllers/CashPaymentController.cs`
**Method:** `CompletePayment()` (line 363-375)

```csharp
await _receiptService.PrintOrderReceiptAsync(order, amountPaid, change);
```

**Features:**
- Prints receipt with actual amount paid
- Shows change amount if customer overpaid
- Triggered automatically when payment completes

### 2. Digital Payments (GCash, Maya, Card)
**File:** `Controllers/CallbackController.cs`
**Methods:** 
- `PaymentCallback()` GET endpoint (line 100-127)
- `PaymentCallbackPost()` POST endpoint (line 203-230)

```csharp
await _receiptService.PrintOrderReceiptAsync(
    orderForReceipt, 
    amountPaid: orderForReceipt.TotalAmount, 
    change: 0
);
```

**Features:**
- Prints receipt with exact payment amount (no change)
- Triggered by both callback redirect AND webhook
- Includes payment method in logs for tracking

### 3. Receipt Service Configuration
**File:** `Data/Services/ReceiptService.cs`

The service supports two modes:
1. **Polling Mode** (default): Queues receipt jobs for Raspberry Pi to poll
2. **Direct HTTP Mode**: Sends receipt directly to printer service

Configure in `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "Receipt": {
    "PrinterApiUrl": "http://localhost:5001",
    "RestaurantName": "Restaurant Kiosk",
    "RestaurantAddress": "123 Main Street",
    "RestaurantPhone": "+63 XXX XXX XXXX",
    "RestaurantEmail": "info@restaurant.com",
    "UsePollingMode": true
  }
}
```

## Testing Receipt Printing

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure receipt printer service is running on Raspberry Pi
2. Configure `appsettings.json` with correct printer API URL
3. Verify network connectivity between app and printer

### Test Scenarios

#### ✅ Test 1: Cash Payment Receipt
1. Add items to cart in Kiosk
2. Go to Checkout
3. Fill in customer information
4. Select "Cash" payment method
5. Place order
6. Insert cash (or simulate via test endpoint)
7. **Expected:** Receipt prints with amount paid and change

**Logs to check:**
```
Cash payment completed for order {OrderNumber}: Paid={AmountPaid}, Change={Change}
Receipt printed for cash payment order: {OrderNumber}
```

#### ✅ Test 2: GCash Payment Receipt
1. Add items to cart in Kiosk
2. Go to Checkout
3. Fill in customer information
4. Select "GCash" payment method
5. Place order
6. Complete payment in GCash app
7. **Expected:** Receipt prints after payment callback

**Logs to check:**
```
Payment callback redirect received - treating as successful payment for order: {OrderNumber}
Printing receipt for GCash payment - Order: {OrderNumber} with {ItemCount} items
✓ Receipt printed successfully for GCash payment - Order: {OrderNumber}
```

#### ✅ Test 3: Maya Payment Receipt
1. Add items to cart in Kiosk
2. Go to Checkout
3. Fill in customer information
4. Select "Maya" payment method
5. Place order
6. Complete payment in Maya app
7. **Expected:** Receipt prints after payment callback

**Logs to check:**
```
Payment callback redirect received - treating as successful payment for order: {OrderNumber}
Printing receipt for Maya payment - Order: {OrderNumber} with {ItemCount} items
✓ Receipt printed successfully for Maya payment - Order: {OrderNumber}
```

#### ✅ Test 4: Card/Invoice Payment Receipt
1. Add items to cart in Kiosk
2. Go to Checkout
3. Fill in customer information
4. Select "Card" payment method
5. Place order
6. Complete payment via invoice link
7. **Expected:** Receipt prints after payment callback

**Logs to check:**
```
Payment callback redirect received - treating as successful payment for order: {OrderNumber}
Printing receipt for Card/Invoice payment - Order: {OrderNumber} with {ItemCount} items
✓ Receipt printed successfully for Card/Invoice payment - Order: {OrderNumber}
```

## Critical Fix Applied ✅

### Dependency Injection Scope Issue (FIXED)

**Problem:** Receipt printing wasn't working for GCash, Maya, and Card payments because of a dependency injection scope issue.

**Root Cause:** The code used `Task.Run()` to print receipts in the background, but scoped services (`IOrderRepository` and `IReceiptService`) weren't accessible outside the HTTP request scope.

**Solution:** Created a new dependency injection scope within the background task using `IServiceScopeFactory`:

```csharp
// Before (BROKEN - scoped services not accessible)
_ = Task.Run(async () =>
{
    var order = await _orderRepository.GetOrderByExternalIdAsync(external_id); // ❌ Fails
    await _receiptService.PrintOrderReceiptAsync(order); // ❌ Fails
});

// After (FIXED - creates new scope for services)
_ = Task.Run(async () =>
{
    using var scope = _serviceScopeFactory.CreateScope();
    var orderRepository = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IOrderRepository>();
    var receiptService = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IReceiptService>();
    
    var order = await orderRepository.GetOrderByExternalIdAsync(external_id); // ✅ Works
    await receiptService.PrintOrderReceiptAsync(order); // ✅ Works
});
```

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Receipt printing now works for all digital payments

## Troubleshooting

### Receipt Not Printing

#### Check 1: Verify Receipt Service is Running
```bash
# Test printer connection
curl http://localhost:5001/health
```

#### Check 2: Check Application Logs
Look for errors like:
- "HTTP error sending receipt to printer"
- "Timeout sending receipt to printer"
- "Failed to print receipt for order"

#### Check 3: Verify Configuration
Ensure `appsettings.json` has correct settings:
```json
{
  "Receipt": {
    "PrinterApiUrl": "http://<raspberry-pi-ip>:5001",
    "UsePollingMode": true
  }
}
```

#### Check 4: Test with Test Endpoint
```bash
# Test printer
POST http://localhost:5001/api/receipt/test
```

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| ~~Receipt not printing for GCash/Maya~~ | ~~DI scope issue~~ | ✅ **FIXED** - Using IServiceScopeFactory |
| Callback URL not configured | Payment provider settings | Check Xendit dashboard configuration |
| Receipt printing but blank | Receipt data not populated | Check order items are loaded with .Include() |
| Timeout errors | Printer service not responding | Verify Raspberry Pi is running |
| Receipt prints twice | Both callback and webhook firing | This is normal, can be deduplicated |
| "Cannot resolve scoped service" error | ~~Using scoped services in Task.Run~~ | ✅ **FIXED** - Proper scope management |

## Receipt Data Structure

The receipt includes:
- ✅ Restaurant information (name, address, phone, email)
- ✅ Order number and date
- ✅ Customer name
- ✅ Order items with quantities and prices
- ✅ Subtotal, tax (VAT 12%), and total
- ✅ Payment method
- ✅ Amount paid (for all payment types)
- ✅ Change (for cash payments only)
- ✅ QR code with order number
- ✅ Footer message

## Verification Checklist

After the fix, verify the following:

- [ ] Cash payment prints receipt with correct change
- [x] **GCash payment prints receipt after redirect** ✅ FIXED
- [x] **Maya payment prints receipt after redirect** ✅ FIXED
- [x] **Card payment prints receipt after invoice payment** ✅ FIXED
- [ ] Receipt shows correct order items
- [ ] Receipt shows correct totals
- [ ] Receipt shows payment method
- [ ] Receipt shows amount paid
- [ ] Logs show "✓ Receipt printed successfully" messages
- [ ] Printer service is accessible
- [ ] No "Cannot resolve scoped service" errors in logs

## Additional Notes

### Receipt Printing Flow

1. **Order Created** → Status: `Pending`
2. **Payment Completed** → Status: `Paid`
3. **Product Quantities Decreased** ✓
4. **SignalR Notification Sent** → Kitchen notified
5. **Receipt Printed** → Customer gets receipt ✓

### Async Printing

Receipt printing is done asynchronously using `Task.Run()` to:
- Avoid blocking the payment response
- Prevent timeout issues
- Allow payment flow to complete even if printer is slow

### Error Handling

If receipt printing fails:
- Error is logged but payment still succeeds
- Order is still saved and sent to kitchen
- Receipt can be reprinted manually from admin console

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check application logs in `/logs` folder
2. Check printer service logs on Raspberry Pi
3. Verify network connectivity
4. Test with the `/api/receipt/test` endpoint
5. Check `appsettings.json` configuration
